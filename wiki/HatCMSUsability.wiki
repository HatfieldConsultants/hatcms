= HatCMS Usability =

The functionality of a content management system (CMS) is obviously a key deciding factor when deciding which CMS to deploy. Equally important is the usability of the CMS.

If staff, particularly authors, cannot easily make use of the CMS, then the system will never be a success, regardless of how powerful it may be.

The good folks at Step Two Designs (http://www.steptwo.com.au) have listed 11 principles of a usable CMS (http://www.steptwo.com.au/papers/kmc_usabilitycms/index.html). They state that a usable CMS will:

  # minimise the number of options 
  # be robust and error-proof 
  # provide task-based interfaces 
  # hide implementation details 
  # meet core usability guidelines 
  # match authors’ mental models 
  # support both frequent and infrequent users 
  # provide efficient user interfaces 
  # provide help and instructions 
  # minimise training required 
  # support self-sufficiency 

*All of these usability principles are at the core of the design of HatCMS*

Step Two notes the following items that a CMS should do to be more usable:
  * Limit the number of options presented to authors
  * Authors must not lose their content due to bugs or crashes
  * Authors don’t want to see the behind-the-scenes details
  * CMS products should not be cluttered with new features
  * Authors only understand ‘pages’ and ‘websites’
  * The CMS must be efficient to use for regular authors
  * Help and instructions should be provided throughout the CMS
  * Authors should not need extensive training
  * Site owners should be able to manage their own sites

*Each of these items are at the core of the design of HatCMS.*
