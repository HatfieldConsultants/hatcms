# About HatCMS 
*HatCMS* is a web application that allows website content to be created and edited by non-technical users.
The whole point of hatCMS is to make it as easy as possible to let any person, regardless of their technical abilities or geographic location, to add and update content on a website.
The user-interface presented by hatCms allows for web-content to be edited in-place as much as possible, and keeps all technical details (such as template creation) away from authors.  As such, authors can focus on content creation, rather than on the actual website design (which is handled by web-design experts).

The usability of HatCMS is discussed on this page: [HatCMSUsability]
